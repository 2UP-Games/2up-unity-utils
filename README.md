# 2UP Games utility packages for Unity

These are internally-written Unity packages that we have found useful at 2UP Games. Included are libraries for communicating with a ComfyUI server, SVG path-walking, Inspector helpers, and more.

The packages are intended to be used as [embedded dependencies](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-embed.html#embed-create). Simply copy any of these folders into your project's Packages directory.

We are not able to provide support or accept pull requests, but please feel free to fork and adapt for your own needs. The code is open source under the liberal [3-clause BSD license](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause).
